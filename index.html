  <h2>Style of the Mastermind:</h2>
  <h4>The style of his work, both in animation and art, is destinctive to many others.</h4>

<h6>IC-0n (Used in Internecion Cube thumbnails)</h6>

<h4>Since the begining, Liam Vickers has had a certain style to his characters. All of his artwork has a clean look to it, with a sense of either mythical monsters, or robots. But, for more wild characters, their designs are scrapy, and have an unneatness value to it somewhere.</h4>
<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/595678ad099c017c17aeddfe/1562833007877-W17ZKKFXCO4WA87BB9CM/Pikachu.jpg?format=2500w" width="300" height="200">
<h6>Fan-Made creepy Picachiu</h6>

<h4>Most of his art has an unsetteling creep factor to it. The sense that, even if its not clear, something is off. A kind of uncomfortability that is enough to, not scare the viewer, but unsettle them a little. However, there is somethimes a constant sense of goffiness in what he draws.</h4>

<h6>Murder Drones Pilot Thumbnail (Stars Serial Designation V center stage)</h6>

<h4>Not everything his makes is meant to be taken seriously. This is evident in the Concept Art for MD, and in his original artwork, not tied to his animations. Suposetly, this is a way to balance out the horror for a bit of a laugh.</h4>

<h6>Uzi Concept Art</h6>

<h4>Yet, more recently, one factor remains the same. A murderous intent. Even if the character he draws looks adorable by all standards, you can tell they can eviserate anybody if they wanted to!</h4>
